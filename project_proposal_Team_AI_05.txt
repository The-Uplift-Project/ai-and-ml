"Ramping up the learning curve; Using online events effectively for upskilling"

In the present times,students are constantly focusing on upskilling themselves.
Online events like podcasts.webinars,workshops conducted by many organizations are playing an important role in this process.
For example, the various events organized by the different chapters of GirlScript Foundation, Coding Blocks, Coding ninjas etc.

Sometimes, student have a diificult time choosing which events to attend.

We would like to build a recommender system for online events that helps by suggesting the upcoming events,
depending on the career aspirations, the areas on which they want to improve, their tech stack of interest etc.

The workflow is as follows:
- Familiarizing with the pre-requisites
- Learning about recommender systems 
- Data collection and formulating the exact problem 
- Implementation
