### Project Objective
We'll be working on bridging the Gap between Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing!<br/>

### Synopsis
We are working on Two Things in parallel one is based on CV and the other is based on NLP which are implemented together by the end of these projects which in-turn forms an end-to-end Deep Learning Based Project<br/>

### Steps followed in the project

* Collecting the Face Masked Human Images<br/>
* Preparing more data by pasting the Mask at the Specific Contours of Human Faces<br/>
* Novel Transfer Learning for Detecting an Unseen Face given very less facial data<br/>
* Hand Gesture based Sentence Generation<br/>
* On the Fly Text Detection of Any Language<br/>
* Overlaying the Converted Text at the same point where the original text is found (For example, replacing a Engilsh Word with German Word)<br/>
* NLP Based Question and Answer based on certain Domains<br/>

### End Goal

* Making a Robust Face Detection(which includes Face Mask detection and social distancing). Once the Distance parameters are satisfied, the person and show their face and Model can automatically identify the capabilities of that person.
* If person is found to be Audibly challenged, sentences can be generated using Hand Gesture Detection and the questions/queries are answered. 
* If a person doesn't know the local language, on-the-fly text conversion can help them to convert it to the language of their choice.
